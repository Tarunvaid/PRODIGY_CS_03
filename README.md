Password Strength Checker Script

The provided Python script is designed to evaluate the strength of a user's password based on several criteria and provide feedback to help the user create a stronger password if necessary. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the script works and its components:

#### Script Breakdown

1. **Imports**:
   - The `re` module is imported to use regular expressions for checking various character types in the password.

2. **Function: `password_strength_checker(password)`**:
   - **Criteria for Password Strength**:
     - **Length**: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
     - **Uppercase Letters**: The password must include at least one uppercase letter.
     - **Lowercase Letters**: The password must include at least one lowercase letter.
     - **Numbers**: The password must include at least one digit.
     - **Special Characters**: The password must include at least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`).

   - **Checking Criteria**:
     - Each criterion is checked using regular expressions and basic length checks.
     - The criteria results are stored as boolean values.

   - **Determining Strength**:
     - The script sums up the number of criteria met.
     - Based on the number of criteria met, it classifies the password strength as:
       - `Very Strong` (all criteria met)
       - `Strong` (4 out of 5 criteria met)
       - `Moderate` (3 out of 5 criteria met)
       - `Weak` (2 out of 5 criteria met)
       - `Very Weak` (0-1 out of 5 criteria met)

   - **Feedback**:
     - The function generates feedback for the user, indicating which criteria were not met.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The script prompts the user to enter a password.
   - It evaluates the password strength and provides feedback.
   - If the password is `Very Strong` or `Strong`, the loop exits.
   - If the password is weaker, the script asks the user to try again with a stronger password.

### Example Usage

1. **Running the Script**:
   - Save the script to a file named `password_strength_checker.py`.
   - Run the script from the terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     python password_strength_checker.py
     ```

2. **User Interaction**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a password.
   - The script evaluates the password and prints its strength.
   - If the password is weak, it provides feedback on how to improve it.
   - The user is asked to enter a new password if the initial one is not strong enough.

### Benefits

- **Security**: Helps users create strong passwords, enhancing security.
- **Feedback**: Provides specific guidance on how to improve the password.
- **User-Friendly**: Interactive and easy to use.

This script is a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve password security by ensuring their passwords meet essential complexity requirements.
